            This is a bunch of music I like. All album covers here are edited to be 8-16 colors for a bit more cohesion. Also cuz i think it's cool.
            Albums are rated on a 0-5 scale, with a 5 being an album I believe to be both nearly perfect and innovative in the genre, and 0 being actively unpleasant to listen to.
        </p>
        <p>
            The "Favorites" category may not always be my actual favorite songs since those can change frequently, it's usually 2-3 songs I think represent the album best.

                        One of the best hip hop records of all time in 
                        terms of nailing a sound, iterating on it, and sticking
                        with it throughout the runtime. Back to back I don't think
                        there's a single song in MTI I would skip, every
                        single one is crazy-ass jazz and memphis samples, twisted
                        beats, and consistently really clever and catchy wordplay from the Mane. It's
                        frankly a little unbelievable that nearly this entire project is made by
                        one dude; Sonically it stands alone over 10 years after it's release despite
                        many attempting to emulate the horrorcore memphis rap style. Ugly did it best
                        here in 2012.

                        Yeah this is a given. One of the most creative and exhilarating albums I've ever heard and my introduction to music 
                        as a whole. Front to back every song is a stand out; DG's production is militant and oppresive glitch hip-hop fronted by
                        some of the most unique and abstract lyrics and delivery ever. Beware is likely the best album opener of all time.
                        Exmilitary will continue to sound like an album from 40 years into the future regardless of when you listen,
                        decidedly one of the best albums of all time.

                        One of my favorites from Aes, I think he really found his style with this release.
                        Even the tracks I don't love manage to paint a really unique and grimey picture sonically, and Aesop delivers some of his best
                        singles ever on this album. Great storytelling, societal commentary, Aesop's thesaurus rap, and jazzy
                        instrumentals from Blockhead and El-P make this a really solid album.

                        Never has an album sounded more like the cover.
                        Billy Wood's half spoken-word half shouting flow (That I admittedly get sick of after a while) backed up by
                        Kenny Segal's atmospheric and haunting instrumentals give this album a uniquly nihilistic sound. Not angry nihilism like Death Grips, but miserable and depressing nihilism.
                        I could see myself laying in bed and rotting away to this, easily one of my favorite hip-hop albums.

                        genre bending would sound less coherent.

                        While still a sonically great set of tracks, Volume 2 is noticably weaker than the other two volumes.
                        The highlight tracks are some of the best in the entire project, but they're surrounded by skits, interludes, and some less
                        interesting tracks. Amazing by most artist standards, just middling for Ugly Mane's.
