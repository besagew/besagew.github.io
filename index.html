            Welcome to my Web Site. This is where I'll be hosting "posts"
            of little essays I don't know where to put otherwise, some cooking recipes 
            I've accumulated over the years, and maybe some experiments with 
            javascript in the Toys section. Maybe more stuff later. Who knows! I have
            so much power here!!
        </p>

            I've always thought the idea of a personal website that lets me edit ALL
            the CSS styles and formatting and stuff would be cool to have, and I don't
            post to any social media because they all suck, so I figure this could
            be fun.

            This is usually the section where you put information about yourself, but
            if you're viewing this site and aren't me, you know who I am already.
